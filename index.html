    <h1>Adam Gilbert - SWEN 101 Intro</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Adam and I went to Harriton High School just outside Philadelphia. My biggest hobbies include a lot of weird programming projects, video production and photography, and server and networking administration.<br />In 2018, I started <a href="https://endlessgroup.org">Endless Group</a>, a 501c3 recognized website <a href="https://theendlessweb.com">hosting</a> and design company. We operate <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/28741">AS400283</a> to provide our network services. <br />I have (much to the dismay of my parents sometimes) been programming since I was about 10 and can now confidently say I know about 7 programming languages. I have been hired on contract this year to build a custom Minecraft minigame server for a summer camp.</p>
    <p>The SE website can be found <a href="http://se.rit.edu">here</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>I hope to learn:</p>
      <li>More about the software engineering processes</li>
      <li>More about how to present to various stakeholders in a project</li>
      <li>More about how to determine project requirements and deliverables</li>
    </ul>
